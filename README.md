# Chrome Extension: WebSS for Figma, A Full-Page Screenshot Splitter for UI/UX Designers

This Chrome extension enables capturing full-page screenshots of any webpage by scrolling and stitching the captured sections together. Unlike standard screenshot tools, it automatically splits the large screenshot into multiple PNG files, each with a maximum height of 4096 pixels, making it easy to handle and analyze very tall pages without losing visual fidelity.

## Overview

This extension is designed especially for UI/UX designers and product teams using Figma or similar design tools who need precise, high-quality screenshots of entire web pages or app prototypes. It provides segmented screenshots ideal for:

- Importing into Figma for detailed UI/UX analysis and annotation  
- Sharing exact page visuals without distortion or compression  
- Managing large pages with sticky navigation bars handled automatically  
- Avoiding image size limitations by splitting into manageable chunks

The resulting images maintain pixel-perfect accuracy without overlapping sticky elements, delivering a seamless experience in visual design workflows.
